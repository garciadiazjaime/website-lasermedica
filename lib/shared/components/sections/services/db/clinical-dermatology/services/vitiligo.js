It can affect different areas of the body and has an unpredictable course. What happens is that the melanocytes of the skin are destroyed by the immune system due to an error, so the production of melanin (substance that pigments the skin) stops. There are several ideas about the cause of this disease, being the patient\'s emotional state one of them.'
